This was a Week 2 day 2 project in which we had to create our own version of the instagram homepage.

To complete this, I played around with a wide variety of CSS properties including floats, margins and a lot more.

I also incorporated external fonts, images and used a colour gradient for final design effects.

Next stages would be adding extra functionality by making the form work and adjust the button design.
